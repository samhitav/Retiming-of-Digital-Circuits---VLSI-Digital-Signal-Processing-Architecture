# Retiming-of-Digital-Circuits---VLSI-Digital-Signal-Processing-Architecture
Retiming is the technique of moving the structural location of latches or registers in a digital circuit to improve its performance, area, and/or power characteristics in such a way that preserves its functional behavior at its outputs.
